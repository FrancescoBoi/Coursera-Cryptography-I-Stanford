# Coursera-Cryptography-I-Stanford
This repository contains the assigments of the Cryptography I course and a pdf summary held by Stanford University on Coursera.

The assignments 1,2,3,5,6 are done in C++11 (C++11 supports lambda expression used), the assignment 4 in python 2. The C++ part uses the libraries: Crypto++ for the crypto algorithms (assignments 2 and 3), gmp and gmpxx for managing bug numbers (assignments 5 and 6): be sure these are installed.

The descriptions of the assignments are in the file.

There is a bash file that when launched compiles the project and creates the output *.o. To lanch the bash file in Unix: bash compileProject.sh
Alternatively just type make to launch the makefile with the commands for compilation.

After compiling to launch the C++ assignments on Unix: ./Crypto.o

To launch the python script: python fileName python command must be associated with the python 2 version.

The mp4 files are used by one assigment.
